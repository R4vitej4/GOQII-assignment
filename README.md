# Goqii Assignment

The task is to develop a RESTful API that allows performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a user entity. The API should manage user data effectively, ensuring that the basic operations are secure, efficient, and adhere to REST principles.

## Features

- Create User
- Read User
- Update User
- Delete User

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: Mysql

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository from GitHub:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/R4vitej4/GOQII-assignment.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install dependencies in the `user-dashboard` and `backend` folders using npm :

   ```
   cd user-dashboard
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**: In the `backend` folder, start the development server using npm:

   ```
   nodemon index.js 
   
   will run at port 8000 in local
   ```

5. **Start the Frontend**: In the `user-dashboard` folder, start the frontend application:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

Note: I am aware that the .env file in the backend folder is exposed. I have intentionally left it that way so you can easily test the application in your local environment.
